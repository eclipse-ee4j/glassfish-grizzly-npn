# Contributing to Eclipse Grizzly

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Writing scalable server applications in the Java™ programming language has
always been difficult. Before the advent of the Java New I/O API (NIO), thread
management issues made it impossible for a server to scale to thousands of
users. The Eclipse Grizzly NIO framework has been designed to help developers to
take advantage of the Java™ NIO API.
